<p>Okay, what the hell...</p>

<p>So steps...</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Create repro in the Web app<br>
    Make sure to make it public<br>
    &ldquo;Set up in desktop&rdquo; button</li>
<li>In the dsktop app save or something<br>
    Make sure and navigate, don't let Git decide where to put it</li>
<li>Open with VS Code (I think)...</li>
<li>Create a new file(?) and save to the location(?)</li>
</ol>
...shit, I don't know, what did I do?</p>

<p>Save in VS Code <br>
Summary, Description, Commit in Git desktop<br>
Oh, and &ldquo;Push origin&rdquo; from Git desktop</p>

<p>I guess this is working... couldn't be more confusing though â€“ so many steps. (And not clear.)</p>
