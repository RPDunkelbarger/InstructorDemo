<p>Okay, what the hell...</p>

<p>So steps...</p>

<p>1) Create repro in the Web app
    Make sure to make it public
    &ldquo;Set up in desktop&rdquo; button
2) In the dsktop app save or something
    Make sure and navigate, don't let Git decide where to put it
3) Open with VS Code (I think)...
4) Create a new file(?) and save to the location(?)
...shit, I don't know, what did I do?</p>

<p>Save in VS Code 
Summary, Description, Commit in Git desktop
Oh, and &ldquo;Push origin&rdquo; from Git desktop</p>

<p>I guess this is working... couldn't be more confusing though â€“ so many steps. (And not clear.)</p>
